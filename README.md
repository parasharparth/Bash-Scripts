# Bash-Scripts

1) The first script is the echo command which prints whatever we want onto the console. It is similar to hello world.
echo command has the following commands present:-

  Options	 ---> Description

  -n	 --->    do not print the trailing newline.
 
  -e	 --->    enable interpretation of backslash escapes.
 
  \b	 --->    backspace
 
  \\	 --->    backslash
 
  \n	 --->    new line
 
  \r	 --->     carriage return
 
  \t	 --->    horizontal tab
 
  \v	 --->    vertical tab
 
  
2) The second script is to write comments in a script.
  
    There are two types of comments in linux scripts
    
    The first is the single line comments which starts with "#" symbol
    
    The second is the multi-line comments which starts with the symbol " : ' " and ends with " ' " symbol
    
3) The third script explains the functionality of the conditional statement .i.e. if-else and also how to declare variables. 

   The most important thing is to check the spaces before and after the brackets
   
   There are a lot of operators for checking the conditions as mentioned below: -
   
   integer comparison

   -eq  --> equal to

   eg:- if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]

   -ne --> is not equal to

   eg :- if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]

   -gt --> is greater than

   eg :- if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]

   -ge --> is greater than or equal to

   eg :- if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]

  -lt --> is less than

   eg :- if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]

  -le  --> is less than or equal to

  eg :- if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]

  < --> is less than (within double parentheses)

  eg :- (("$a" < "$b"))

  <= --> is less than or equal to (within double parentheses)

  eg :-  (("$a" <= "$b"))

  > --> is greater than (within double parentheses)

  eg :-  (("$a" > "$b"))

  >= --> is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)

  eg :- (("$a" >= "$b"))
